/**
 * This is the test class for {@link NameFinderME}.
 * <p>
 * A proper testing and evaluation of the name finder
 * is only possible  with a large corpus which contains
 * a huge amount of test sentences.
 * <p>
 * The scope of this test is to make sure that the name finder
 * code can be executed. This test can not detect
 * mistakes which lead to incorrect feature generation
 * or other mistakes which decrease the tagging
 * performance of the name finder.
 * <p>
 * In this test the {@link NameFinderME} is trained with
 * a small amount of training sentences and then the
 * computed model is used to predict sentences from the
 * training sentences.
